@sudo@ may be configured to stop requesting passwords for specific commands to specific users or groups. This is very convenient for personal computers where there is only a user (and therefore she's the administrator).

With next file @/etc/sudoers.d/apt@, the @sudo@ group members will be allowed to run @apt@, @apt-get@ and @dpkg@ commands absolutelly with no password.

For other users, the @sudo@ behaviour do not change.

<pre>
Defaults        env_reset, insults
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
Defaults        timestamp_timeout=15

Cmnd_Alias APT = /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/dpkg
%sudo ALL = (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: APT
</pre>

Option 'timestamp_timeout' sets the time (in minutes) that the password will remain in cache, so it will not ask for it during that period. The value 0 disables the cache.
